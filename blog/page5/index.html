            <h1><a href="/blog/2013/08/18/hacker-dojo-community-trading-zone/">Hacker Dojo: Community Trading Zone</a></h1>
            <p>I recently came out of a Hacker Dojo board meeting, as I do every month, but this time with a renewed sense of excitement for Hacker Dojo. We began with the usual board meeting stuff — finances, staff benefits, etc — but there was one final item to discuss that's more in tune with the reason I'm even on the board. There has been an increasingly pressing issue around what Hacker Dojo is. We used to know what it was and had a reasonable idea of what we always wanted it to be, but we've grown, we've learned, and our model has to adapt. This discussion led to a rethinking of the conceptual structure of Hacker Dojo.</p>

<p>One of the reasons this came up is growth. We've had consistent membership growth with only a couple expected downturns, due to various setbacks. For example, when we were temporarily limited to a maximum occupancy of 49 people, membership dropped because people couldn't throw the same events as before. Despite setbacks, we've had impressive long-term growth. If you describe us as a "hackerspace," we are the largest in the United Sates, and I believe one of the largest in the world. It's clear that overall we're doing quite well, but we want to take it further. We want to keep pushing because Hacker Dojo means a lot to all of us and we want to see it, and the culture and ideals that go with it, reach new people and new places.</p>

<p>We've always talked about franchising and starting new locations, but we've learned that a single, 24/7 location with 400 members and around 2,000 people coming through every month is quite difficult to run, especially as a bootstrapped non-profit with minimal staff. We've had sponsorships, but we work hard for those sponsorships and provide services to receive them. Most of our income comes from membership fees. Despite all this we're trying our best to continue to take Hacker Dojo to the next level, and it should be noted we have been quite successful so far, for many reasons that could go into another long blog post.</p>

<p>Scaling any organization is hard. Scaling an organization like this one can be extra difficult, especially when we're trying to maintain the grassroots, bottom-up, culture that started it. We've always tried to support the concept of a democratic organization. For the first few years we were 100% volunteer run, with no paid employees. The growth of Hacker Dojo has generated lot of extra work to get done that nobody really wants to do. Raising money, working with the city, organizing contractors, dealing with financial issues, having to move to a new location and rent the previous one … all this requires a LOT of leg work and consistent attention that just wasn't happening with volunteers.</p>

<p>Eventually, you need to start hiring full or part-time people. We now have a small staff of paid employees who tackle these more time-intensive tasks. While this has helped us manage the growth, it has created a kind of interesting tension between the forces of the democratic, bottom-up nature of our organization and the forces of more traditional, more centralized modes of operation necessary for efficient execution of a vision. The vision being in the short-term to improve the quality of the experience at Hacker Dojo, and in the long-term to bring Hacker Dojo and all that it stands for — what some have called the epitome of true Silicon Valley culture — to more people.</p>

<p>This tension has been healthy and has helped Hacker Dojo often reap the benefits of both worlds. However, as we grow, so does the tension and discussion around it. This was the catalyst for our discussion at the board meeting. Now the realization I'm excited about is somewhat of an aside from this issue of tension, but the issue was the catalyst for revisiting what Hacker Dojo is. I quite enjoy the occasional existential crisis as it often results in refreshed sense of purpose and meaning.</p>

<p>We revisited many ideas, for example that Hacker Dojo is a platform, and like many platforms it can be hard to describe. We serve purposes in the worlds of education, business, social, and many others. We'd talked about how Hacker Dojo has played a part in not just projects and startups, but relationships — partnerships, friendships, and even marriages. We considered different organizations for analogy: universities, incubators, fraternities, and anything else that comes close to an existing framework for all the amazingness that Hacker Dojo produces.</p>

<p>Then it hit us. Communities. Plural.</p>

<p>What we realized is that we've effectively been treating Hacker Dojo as one community. We've sort of acknowledged that there are sub-groups within Hacker Dojo, but we've more or less operated under the assumption that we serve two types of citizens: members and the general public. As we've gotten larger, it's become much more difficult to effectively treat either of those as one group. The reality is that they are all actually part of many communities.</p>

<p>The idea was right under our nose the whole time, just under a different guise. Events have always been a core part of Hacker Dojo because Hacker Dojo started with the idea that it could be a place where people could meet and host events like the event that inspired Hacker Dojo itself, SuperHappyDevHouse. When an event happens on a regular basis it turns into a community. A group of people with a common interest and/or set of values come together, turn into a community, and these communities grow, develop, and spawn really interesting things, just as SuperHappyDevHouse spawned Hacker Dojo.</p>

<p>Hacker Dojo now serves many communities both inside and outside of Hacker Dojo; not only internal communities but external ones as well. External communities can also leverage the infrastructure that Hacker Dojo provides. These communities might already have a member of Hacker Dojo, or someone in the community chooses to become a member of Hacker Dojo, usually to throw an event. Once that community gets into Hacker Dojo, they not only see Hacker Dojo, but all the other communities that come together under our roof. Sometimes this inspires even more people to sign up as members, not just to be a part of Hacker Dojo, but to participate in and see what other communities Hacker Dojo offers.</p>

<p>We're now thinking of Hacker Dojo not just as a community hub, but as a hub of communities. A community <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_zones">trading zone</a>, if you will. While we will always support and listen to individual members, we should begin to think of communities, in the plural, as first-class citizens of Hacker Dojo. This may seem like a subtle change but it is a big difference. It means acknowledging and supporting the communities that operate in and around Hacker Dojo. It means going to those communities and asking how we can better serve <em>them as a community</em>, not just individual members.</p>

<p>By connecting with communities we can provide infrastructure to foster their growth and development. Imagine going to the Hacker Dojo website and seeing a page devoted to the many communities of Hacker Dojo. When a new member signs up they could indicate their interests and we could provide them with a list of communities they might be interested in. Hacker Dojo would in a sense then be improving the communities' "deal flow."</p>

<p>Rethinking Hacker Dojo as infrastructure for communities has led to lots of exciting new ideas. By focusing on empowering them with infrastructure that allows them to flourish, we are then supporting our members in a more meaningful way.</p>

<p>I'm hoping this simple change in the way the board and members invested in Hacker Dojo think about Hacker Dojo will hopefully lead to lots of positive change. We don't have these conversations very often on the board but we need to have them to maintain the vision of Hacker Dojo and we need to have them in public. Clearly this is a collaborative effort, so we want to know how the general community feels about this idea. So I'm putting this out there, and hopefully it will lead to more exciting discussions.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">Dokku</a> is a mini-Heroku powered by Docker written in less than 100 lines of Bash. Once it's set up on a host, you can push Heroku-compatible applications to it via Git. They'll build using Heroku buildpacks and then run in isolated containers. The end result is your own, single-host version of Heroku.</p>

<p>Dokku is under 100 lines because it's built out of several components that do most of the heavy lifting: Docker, Buildstep, and gitreceive.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.docker.io/">Docker</a> is a container runtime for Linux. This is a high-level container primitive that gives you a similar technology to what powers Heroku Dynos. It provides the heart of Dokku.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/progrium/buildstep">Buildstep</a> uses Heroku's open source buildpacks and is responsible for building the base images that applications are built on. You can think of it as producing the "stack" for Dokku, to borrow a concept from Heroku.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/progrium/gitreceive">Gitreceive</a> is a project that provides you with a git user that you can push repositories to. It also triggers a script to handle that push. This provides the push mechanism that you might be familiar with from Heroku.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few other projects being developed to support Dokku and expand its functionality without inflating its line count. Each project is independently useful, but I'll share more about these as they're integrated into Dokku.</p>

<p>For now, here's a screencast that shows how to set up Dokku, along with a quick walk-through of the code.</p>

            <p>A few weeks ago I was completely consumed for
the better part of a day that I would have otherwise spent on more practical
work.</p>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"> </script>

<p>This wishful brainstorming inspired me to start building exactly that.
But first, a digression.</p>

<p>The idea reminded me of an idea I got from <a href="https://twitter.com/rndmcnlly">Adam
Smith</a> back when I was working on
Scriptlets. If you can execute code from a URL, you could "store" a
program in a shortened URL. I decided to combine this with the
curl-pipe-bash technique that's been starting to get popular to
bootstrap installs. If you're unfamiliar, take this Gist of a Bash
script:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4464431.js"> </script>

<p>Given the "view raw" URL for that Gist, you can curl it and pipe it into Bash to
execute it right there in your shell. It would look like this:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ curl -s https://gist.github.com/raw/4464431/gistfile1.txt | bash
Hello world
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of having Gist store the program, how could we make it so the
source would just live within the URL? Well in the case of
curl-pipe-bash, we just need that source to be returned in the body of a
URL. So I built a simple app to run on Heroku that takes the query
string and outputs it in the body, a sort of echo service.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4464442.js"> </script>

<p>Letting you do this:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ curl "http://queryecho.herokuapp.com?Hello+world"
Hello world
</code></pre>

<p>Which you could conceal and shorten with a URL shortener, like Bitly. I
prefer the j.mp domain Bitly has. And since they're just redirecting you to the
long URL, you'd use the <code>-L</code> option in curl to make it follow redirects:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ curl -L http://j.mp/RyUN03
Hello world
</code></pre>

<p>When you make a short URL from the bitly website, they conveniently make
sure the query string is properly URL encoded. So if I just typed
<code>queryecho.herokuapp.com/?echo "Hello world"</code> into bitly, it
would give me a short URL with a properly URL encoded version of that
URL that would return <code>echo "Hello world"</code>. This URL we could then curl-pipe into Bash:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ curl -Ls http://j.mp/VGgI3o | bash
Hello world
</code></pre>

<p>See what's going on there? We wrote a simple Hello world program in Bash
that effectively lives in that short URL. And we can run it with
the curl-pipe-bash technique.</p>

<p>Later in our conversation, Joel suggests an example "app tweet" that if
executed in Bash given a URL argument, it would tell you where it
redirects. So if you gave it a short URL, it would tell you the long
URL.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-in-reply-to="279032107265839104"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/progrium">progrium</a> $ echo "$1"; curl -IL --silent "$1" | grep Location | grep -o 'http.*' # this is a URL "unshortener"</p>&mdash; Joël Franusic (@jf) <a href="https://twitter.com/jf/status/279033679592951809" data-datetime="2012-12-13T01:23:08+00:00">December 12, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"> </script>

<p>Just so you know what it would look like, if you put that program in a
shell script and ran it against a short URL that redirected to www.google.com, this is what you would see:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ ./unshortener.sh http://j.mp/www-google-com
http://j.mp/www-google-com
http://www.google.com/
</code></pre>

<p>It prints the URL you gave it and then resolves the URL and
prints the long URL. Pretty simple.</p>

<p>So I decided to put this program in a short URL. Here we have <a href="http://j.mp/TaHyRh">j.mp/TaHyRh</a> which will resolve to:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>http://queryecho.herokuapp.com/?echo%20%22$url%22;%20curl%20-ILs%20%22$url%22%20|%20grep%20Location%20|%20grep%20-o%20'http.*'
</code></pre>

<p>Luckily I didn't have to do all that URL encoding. I just pasted his
code in after <code>queryecho.herokuapp.com/?</code> and bitly took care of it.
What's funny is that this example program is made to run on short URLs,
so when I told him about it, my example ran on the short URL that
contained the program itself:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ curl -Ls http://j.mp/TaHyRh | url=http://j.mp/TaHyRh bash
http://j.mp/TaHyRh
http://queryecho.herokuapp.com/?echo "$url"; curl -ILs "$url" | grep Location | grep -o 'http.*'
</code></pre>

<p>You may have noticed my version of the program uses <code>$url</code> instead of
<code>$1</code> because we have to use environment variables to provide input to
curl-pipe-bash scripts. For reference, to run my URL script against the
google.com short URL we made before, it would look like this:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ curl -Ls http://j.mp/TaHyRh | url=http://j.mp/www-google-com bash
http://j.mp/www-google-com
http://www.google.com/
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so we can now put Bash scripts in short URLs. What happened to
installing apps in Tweets? Building an <code>apptweet</code> program like Joel
imagined would actually be pretty straightforward. But I wanted to build
it in and install it with these weird programs-in-short-URLs.</p>

<p>The first obstacle was figuring out how to get it to modify your current
environment. Normally curl-pipe-bash URLs install a downloaded program
into your <code>PATH</code>. But I didn't want to install a bunch of files on your
computer. Instead I just wanted to install a temporary Bash function
that would disappear when you leave your shell session. In order to do
this, I had to do a variant of the curl-pipe-bash technique using eval:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ eval $(curl -Ls http://j.mp/setup-fetchtweet)
$ fetchtweet 279072855206031360
@jf you asked for it... Jeff Lindsay (@progrium) December 13, 2012
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see by inspecting that URL, it just defines a Bash function
that runs a Python script from a Gist. I cheated and used Gist for some
reason. That Python script uses the Twitter embed endpoint (same one
used for the embedded Tweets in this post) to get the contents of a
Tweet without authentication.</p>

<p>The next thing I built installed and used fetchtweet
to get a Tweet, parse it, put it in a Bash function named by the string
after an <code>#exectweet</code> hashtag (which happens to also start a comment in Bash). So here we have a Tweet with a program in it:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>echo Hello world <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23exectweet">#exectweet</a> helloworld</p>&mdash; Jeff Lindsay (@progrium) <a href="https://twitter.com/progrium/status/279087620145958912" data-datetime="2012-12-13T04:57:28+00:00">December 12, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"> </script>

<p>To install it, we'd run this:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ id=279087620145958912 eval $(curl -Ls http://j.mp/install-tweet)
Installed helloworld from Tweet 279087620145958912
$ helloworld
Hello world
</code></pre>

<p>We just installed a program from a Tweet and ran it! Then I wrapped this
up into a command you could install. To install the installer. This time it would let you give it the URL to a Tweet:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ eval $(curl -Ls http://j.mp/install-exectweet) 
Installed exectweet
$ exectweet https://twitter.com/progrium/status/279087620145958912
Installed helloworld from Tweet 279087620145958912
$ helloworld
Hello world
