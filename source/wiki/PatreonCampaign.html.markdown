# Jeff Lindsay is creating amazing open source tools, videos, and articles.

## Who are you?

My name is Jeff Lindsay. I'm an open source programmer from San Jose, California now living in Austin, Texas.

I build tools. I can't help it. I think a lot about how to increase the capability of anybody that can code. And how to make it easier, pleasant even, to do things the right way. But mostly how to make possible what a younger version of myself would stay up late wishing for. 

In the process, I envisioned webhooks, started SuperHappyDevHouse, built RequestBin, localtunnel, gave talks, co-founded Hacker Dojo, helped create Docker, built Dokku, and over 100 other projects. I also worked at NASA once! I've also inspired many other projects and communities, and have just been around for a lot of amazing things.
