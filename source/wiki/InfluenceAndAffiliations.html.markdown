# Influence and Affiliations

Beyond projects that I can call my own, I've had the privilege to be involved or affiliated with some great people and projects. Together we have had quite an impact on the world, changing individuals lives to influencing major technological and cultural phenomena. Here is a place I feel comfortable sharing some of them.

Oddly enough, most of these trace back to 2005 at the dawn of "Web 2.0" and a legendary event and community called [SuperHappyDevHouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperHappyDevHouse) (which I refer to as DevHouse). 

## Hackathons

The first couple [hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) seemed to occur around 1999, but hackathons became widespread from 2005 to 2010. Interestingly enough, this is the period the original DevHouse events occured. Given the size and influential location and attendance of DevHouse, it's hard to imagine it was just a correlation.

Yahoo! Hack Day in 2006 was one of the first open, commercial hackathons after the Web 2.0 boom. I attended the first of these and in the invitation request form I mentioned my involvement in DevHouse. They replied citing DevHouse as an influence. From then on, many tech companies used hackathons to help market their platforms and APIs.

In 2013, Jon Gottfried, co-founder of Major League Hacking, described DevHouse as the "mother of modern hackathons". 

Ironically, DevHouse was never considered a hackathon in the way most hackathons are run. It was a casual party-like atmosphere with coding and projects, but there were no competitions or extrinsic motivators for attendance. It also had no commercial agenda and was 100% community run. 

## Facebook

Facebook started hackathons that were internal and helped re-inforce their values around [The Hacker Way](http://www.wired.com/2012/02/zuck-letter/). Unlike most hackathons, the Facebook hackathons actually reflected the spirit of DevHouse around unfettered creation. This led to major features including the Like button, which has become a defining feature of the platform.

This tradition of [legendary](http://www.fastcompany.com/3002845/secrets-facebooks-legendary-hackathons-revealed) Facebook hackathons turns out to be [directly inspired by DevHouse](https://www.quora.com/Who-brought-hackathon-to-Facebook). Apparently Facebook employee Scott Marlette attended DevHouse and told Mark Zuckerberg about it over lunch. Mark Zuckerberg "thought it was a good idea and that we should have one in the office."

## Minecraft

Around the time of starting DevHouse in 2005, I became friends with indie gamemaker Derek Yu. He was running a blog called [TIGSource](http://tig.wikia.com/wiki/TIGSource) on indie games. He was having trouble with their hosting provider, so I offered to help out. I became the TIGSource sysadmin. At Derek's request, I set up forums for TIGSource. 

Those forums turned TIGSource into a major breeding ground for indie games of all kinds. Some major indie titles that were first shared there included Fez, Super Meat Boy, Spelunky, World of Goo, and Braid. 

There was one blowout success that stands alone: Minecraft. I only found out in that last couple years that it made its debut on the TIGSource forums. The TIGSource forums and IRC were also used to help come up with the name Minecraft.

## BarCamp and Unconferences

Modern web pioneer [Tantek Çelik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantek_%C3%87elik) was a regular at the original DevHouse events. In 2005 after the second DevHouse, he and a cohort of a few other DevHouse regulars [dreamed up](http://tantek.com/2015/225/t2/10-years-ago-created-barcamp) [BarCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp), a free and attendee-driven technology [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) that inspired thousands of other BarCamps and unconferences around the world. 

Although the core ideas behind unconferences had been around since the 80s, BloggerCon and FooCamp brought the term unconference into use in 2003. The explosion of BarCamp in 2005 helped bring it into widespread use.

During the closing remarks of the first BarCamp, Tantek mentioned DevHouse as a source of inspiration for the event. Particularly the grassroots "just do it" attitude of the organizers. 

## Coworking

In 2005, Brad Neuberg coined [coworking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking) and started the first pilot coworking space in SF. DevHouse co-founder [David Weekly](http://blog.dweek.ly/) introduced him to me at DevHouse and we bonded briefly over a shared appreciation of Will Wright and systems thinking. Brad, too, became a frequent attendee and later was one of several people to bring legendary [Doug Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) to DevHouse.

With fellow DevHouse regular [Chris Messina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Messina_(open_source_advocate)), Brad co-founded the first work-only coworking space in SF called Citizen Space. They helped turn it into a movement that has now become an entire industry. Roughly 700 coworking spaces exist in the US and one report shows coworking spaces doubling every year.

## Hashtag and Twitter Stream

Many of the DevHouse regulars were early Twitter users. A number of the original Twitter developers also attended DevHouse. Chris Messina suggested we use hashtags to identify groups and tag our tweets. Twitter later adopted this as a native feature. As Twitter went mainstream, so did the hashtag. 

The early Twitter engineering team was also present at DevHouse in 2007 for one of my [first presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/progrium/web-hooks) on webhooks and they said it sounded like a good idea. I followed up with them, urging them to implement webhooks (they'd be one of the first), but they had scaling concerns and instead opted for a persistent firehose connection. This became the Twitter Streaming API that enabled huge amounts of innovation around Twitter and was even an early way Twitter tried to monetize their platform.

## Homebrew Computer Club

I grew up in the SF bay area and as a techie kid, and I loved the history of Silicon Valley. In particular I was fascinated by an event in the 70s and 80s called Homebrew Computer Club, made famous as an event Jobs and Wozniak first attended to demo their Apple computer. But it was a breeding ground of innovation around personal computing. Among many others, one of their founding members, [Lee Felsenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Felsenstein), went on to design the first mass produced portable computer. Homebrew has been called "the crucible for an entire industry."

I felt that DevHouse was the closest thing to a spiritual successor to Homebrew. Myself and fellow DevHouse organizer [Joël Franusic](http://joel.franusic.com/) took this very seriously given our respect and fascination with the previous generation of hackers. I mentioned this to a Mercury News reporter that was covering DevHouse. The article got in front of Lee Felsenstein, causing him to show up at the next event. He became a DevHouse regular and participated in a number of community events that spun out of DevHouse. 

In 2013, Lee, Joël, and Matt Spergel put together a [Homebrew Computer Club Reunion](http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/the-homebrew-computer-club-2013-reunion/) with the Computer History Museum.
