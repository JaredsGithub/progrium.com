# Pop Computing

Pop computing, sterile computing, or mass produced computing describes the ironic sterilization of computing, which is fundamentally a generative technology. Closed, walled-garden, dumbed down, consumer technology. Focusing on vertical solutions, these productizations of computing tend to limit what's possible with computing as an open, generative platform.
