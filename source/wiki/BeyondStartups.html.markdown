# Beyond Startups

Startup culture is the best thing that's happened to technologists since they first discovered their intrinsic love for technology. Startups provide a vehicle for creative technologists to get paid, even handsomely, for their drive to be creative with technology. 

It used to be that you needed somebody with business vision and hustle to come along and motivate you to channel your energy into a startup with them. Woz had to be convinced by Jobs they should do Apple. Now after so many success stories, it's the norm for technologists to read a few Paul Graham essays, learn the skills and accessible tools to run a business, and apply for an accelerator. 

Today there is rarely a case when a computer programmer works on a hobby project and doesn't consider the possibility of doing it as a startup or bootstrap business.

We live in a world where "free money" is readily available to entrepreneurs that can pitch. There are blog posts and books and conferences motivating people to take the chance to change the world and do a startup. If it doesn't work out, a programmer can nearly always fall back to an extremely well paid job working at Google, or Facebook, or Twitter, or Uber, or Dropbox, etc, etc. 

Could there possibly be something wrong with this setup?

## Value beyond market value

It's not so much what's wrong with it, but what value and opportunity is being left out. What are we missing out on that this system makes us blind to?

My hypothesis is one that might only make sense to true technologists. By this I mean people that are, or have been at one time, motivated by the combination of creativity and computer technology. People excited by possibilities of what they could do or build with some new platform or some new tool.

Perhaps many of these people have grown to value wealth and/or wealth generation measured in potential dollars more than what got them into this business in the first place. The engineers turned VCs. The hardcore capitalists. Go big or go home. There is nothing wrong with these people, but they just might have a hard time seeing beyond startups.

Startups only focus on value that can scale and at some point be measured in dollars. Twitter is super cool, captured a huge userbase, for the longest time didn't make money. But it continued to exist because investors believed it had the potential to figure out how to make money. Lots of it. 

Traction is a common indicator of potential to monetize. It's valued like money because it represents potential money. Sort of like how money represents (but isn't) value?

My argument is that there are ideas and technologies that exist on a spectrum of value that *are* worthwhile, but are ignored because they don't work as a startup. 

Experienced entrepreneurs learned this lesson pretty quickly, but usually in a way that paints those ideas as *not* having value. I'm not saying bad ideas don't exist. There are *certainly* ideas that are truly "in search of a problem". Customer discovery and lean methodology has done wonders in helping entrepreneurs find a product that not only solves a problem but will sell. That's what you need to have a sustainable business. 

However, there are plenty of ideas and technologies that I argue *should* exist, *solve* a problem, create value, but don't make the cut for being startup worthy. In other words, they don't make enough money to grow a business with, let alone a VC funded startup. And these are often discarded.

## A trite example of value without business value

Let me back up and provide an example of the mismatch between startup or business value and the full spectrum of actual value. It might be easy to concede there is "lesser value" that the startup world rightly ignores because it doesn't make money. I'll get to examples of that in a bit. First, I want to explore music as an example of serious value that no longer sustains "business value". 

As they say, it's near impossible to make money making music. Not just as a nobody. Even top artists have struggled with the technological and cultural shifts that have made it hard to get people to pay for music. Has the value of music changed? 

Yes, it's easier than ever to get music for free if you really want. Does that make it less valuable? The reality of free markets shows it does, but is that the whole answer? The mismatch between this new reality and artists that know their work has value has created a lot of frustration. Slowly they've adapted and come to realize there's different kinds of value. Only one of which is business value.

There's also more music now than ever before. Obviously market value drops. But in this new long tail are songs that resonate with certain individuals more than songs designed for a mass audience that once sold half a million units. In a way, the value of music is increased in aggregate. There's more music and more opportunity to find more artists that you love. 

Too bad they can't make a living just selling the music they love to make. Instead they have to find alternative "products" that still have market value. Shows. Merchandise. Obvious examples, but the good ones get creative. 

By the way, some don't figure out how to make a living with it. Yet they continue to make music anyway. Good music even. Why is that? Are starving artists delusional or are they just preoccupied by a compulsion to create in a medium that works for them?

## Back to startups and technology

There are plenty of ideas and technologies that *should* exist, *solve* a problem, create *value*, but don't make the cut for being a fundable startup. Or worse, they're funded and built but don't have the necessary growth despite being used and perhaps loved. So they shutdown and disappear. 

*Or perhaps even worse.* They're funded, they're successful, they're loved, and they're bought. They did it! Then the technology they built is shutdown, disappears, and is eventually forgotten. A recent example of this is Parse, but this happens *a lot*. Good thing the founders made a lot of money, that was the goal right??

What if your goal is to make a technology exist. You know the value of it because it provides you value, maybe others get it, and, man, it would suck if it didn't exist. Turns out, even if it works as a startup, that might still happen. 

It should be obvious but startups are about operations and money more than technology. For technologists interested in building good technology, startups are an option, but in same cases **the only option.**

We even see the value but we discard it because it won't sustain a startup. VCs might say "this is a feature, not a product", or similarly I love "this is a vitamin, not a pill". For entrepreneurs looking to do a startup, this is huge to understand. 

Some might work as "lifestyle businesses". Depending on product-market fit, this can also be a struggle. And because bootstrapping is cheaper and your success metric is less pointed, it can be harder to see when it's not going to work.
