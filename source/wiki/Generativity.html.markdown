# Generativity

In 2008 Jonathan Zittrain wrote a book called [The Future of the Internet and How To Stop It](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089EHNC2/). For me, the most important idea in the book is the model of two types of technologies: sterile and generative. Here I'd like to explore this model and talk about why generative technologies are important. If you'd like to learn more about the actual topic of the book, [here is a good summary review](http://boingboing.net/2008/07/23/zittrains-the-future.html). 

Zittrain describes sterile technologies as those with a fixed purpose or use. They're made for one thing and don't really surprise you. Another way to think of them are as appliances. Most appliances are sterile. Your toaster is pretty much only good as a toaster. The smoke alarm in your house is only good as a smoke alarm. 

Generative technologies are those with more potential uses than the creator could imagine. They're general, repurposeable, and very often surprising in how they're used. One of the most generative technologies we have is the computer. The Internet and the web are also generative technologies. At the content layer on top of the web, Wikipedia is a generative technology. 

Most technology falls somewhere in between sterile and generative. Or perhaps, are a little of both. In computing, Zittrain describes certain devices as "tethered", which is to say, generative, but not absolutely generative. The iPhone and the App Store best represent tethering. It feels generative, that anybody can create new uses for the device by making apps, but there is a gatekeeper: Apple. Truly generative technologies and platforms don't have a single gatekeeper in their ecosystem, for example the Internet, the web, Wikipedia. 

Zittrain remains mostly neutral on whether sterile or generative is better. He argues that your car should probably be a sterile technology. This is because generative systems can grow messy but also be abused by malicious 3rd parties. Truly generative systems can often be compared to the wild west. And because of that, we let companies sterilize and exert control over these technologies. 

The book ends up focusing on this struggle. This is a worthwhile problem to explore, but regardless, to me it's the idea of [generativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generativity) that represents something more important. I'm not against sterile technologies, but I will say I have a bias towards more generative technologies. 


Business loves sterile technology. Not only can businesses better manage a predictable system, but sterile is easier to market. A product needs to solve a specific problem for people to easily see a need for it. This is why products tend to have a fixed purpose in marketing if not by design.

A product that has multiple uses is counter-intuitively harder to market until the uses are well known, like baking soda and personal computers. 

Twilio, for example, is a very generative product. Although it found solid bottom up adoption from developers, enterprise marketing had to focus on a number of problem-specific solutions on top of it. This is often a necessary strategy for API and platform companies.

Besides marketability, generativity often comes with a number of other challenges for businesses. Having untethered uses is a support nightmare. Also, general purpose tools often have less affordances for their specific uses, so they can be confusing and harder to adopt. Uses and applications from malicious third parties hurt product reputation. These all have costs that are easier to manage by limiting generativity.


Another way to say it, sterile technology is more consumer friendly. By keeping it simple and focused, it's easier to market and easier to use. 

The personal computer is arguably the most generative technology we have. You can imagine the marketing challenge in front of early PC vendors. Most opted to piggy back on the known business use cases from the previous generation of computers. 

Steve Jobs had a different idea. He knew how special the computer was, often citing the magic of one mind and one computer. His mission was to make computing truly personal on a mass scale. Beyond hobbyists and beyond the workplace. 

The way he felt he could do this was to make the computer as much into appliance as possible. He knew the real generativity was in software, so make the hardware sterile. Plug it in, turn it on, then point and click to enlightenment.

But Jobs was a control freak. He tried wherever possible to make the software sterile or at least tethered as well. Can you imagine how excited he was to move Apple into consumer electronics? Actual appliances! If you recall, he even tried to get away with making the iPhone a closed, sterile appliance with no 3rd party apps.


This appliance strategy started with the Apple II, but since the Apple II was really Wozniak's baby, it ended up being the most generative computer Apple released. In fact, Woz and Jobs had a long-running argument that perfectly captures sterile vs generative: the Apple II expansion slots.

Woz wanted 8 expansion slots in the Apple II. The more slots, the more functionality 3rd parties could add to the device. Effectively making it more generative. Jobs only wanted two slots that could be for two specific addons: a modem and a printer. Fixed, predictable, sterile.

Thinking about the Steve Jobs journey from the perspective of this strategy around sterile appliances actually makes it all the more remarkable. The Apple II was a success, but it would seem as though is was because of its generativity that Woz kept intact. 

Every computer product Jobs attempted to orchestrate afterwards applied the appliance strategy in full force, and seemed to only result in failure after failure. From the Lisa, to the Macintosh, to the Next Computer. The failures weren't necessarily because of the strategy, but most people might think it had something to do with it.

Finally, with his return to Apple, the timing was right for the iMac. And it certainly was timing, the technology was cheap enough and the PC market was large enough that the strategy finally had a chance. It worked and Apple never looked back, but it would seem Steve Jobs not once doubted the appliance strategy.

I don't believe computers are supposed to be sterile. It doesn't make sense. They're inherently generative. And it wasn't just Jobs that pushed them to be more sterilized. Every business in the industry wanted to make computers sell more, so they were all incentivized to dumb down and sterilize computing. 

The end result is that computing is everywhere, but it's a severly stunted form of computing I call Pop Computing.

The Apple II slots argument not only shows that Jobs had a preference for sterile technology, but that Woz had a preference for generative technology. The reason I say this is because Woz represents hacker culture. He's basically the hacker's hacker. And I don't believe his bias for generativity is separate from his values as a hacker. 

I'm beginning to define a hacker as a person that needs to use and build generative technology. It might not be a conscious idea, and they might not know why, but I believe generativity is part of hacker DNA. 

Think about it, they prefer using technologies that have more generative properties. Open source, extensible, programmable ... "hackable". They often have an unexplainable distaste for products on the more sterile side, like Apple products. Most hacks, including life hacks, are a form of repurposing, which is applying generativity where it wasn't before. Jailbreaking the iPhone is making a sterile device more generative. 

You can say hackers are about values of freedom like open source or free software, or about unchaining from control and authority. But there are plenty of hackers that are okay with some control, or okay with closed source. Even open source itself is a less extreme version of free software, so clearly that doesn't represent the heart of hacker culture. 

I think hacker culture is about a bias towards generativity. 

Generativity becomes more significant when looked at from the context of technology in general.

Kevin Kelly explored in his book What Technology Wants the biases and trends of technology. He broadly defines technology as anything useful created by a human mind, which includes, for example, law and cities. What he found is that technology 
in all forms help us trend towards:

 * Options
 * Choices
 * Opportunities
 * Possibilities
 * Freedoms
 
Which are lots of different ways of talking about the same thing. What this does, though, is with each new technology, that brings us the potential for more new technology. That doesn't sound that significant, but as Kevin Kelly says, imagine Mozart before the piano, or van Gogh before cheap oil paints, or Hitchcock before film. 

How many kids are out there today that won't realize their potential to self actualize because their medium doesn't exist yet? Where the thing that resonates so perfectly with that individual that it fills their life with purpose and meaning.

Just as one example, Vine has allowed for a new form a celebrity: Vine stars. This is different from being a movie star, or even being a YouTube star. It's an opportunity that didn't exist before. 

In contrast, imagine a world without technology, where we were incapable of making any sort of technology. Including hunting tools, fire, language. We as a species would not survive nature. 

So it seems, at least in general, the force of technology is a Good Thing. It's arguably what makes us human, or at least what helped establish humanity.

Generative technology is more aligned with the basic trend of technology than sterile. In that way, it's a more potent form of technology. So as a technologist that understands the value in technology in general, it makes sense there would be a bias towards generative technology.

In the end, to me, generativity is an ideal. Something we should strive for. It's not always practical, and sometimes you need give it up a little to get more of it, but I think it's worth fighting for. Having the choice of whether our technology is sterile or generative is a Good Thing, but a consumer driven society will unfortunately always be biased towards sterile technology.
